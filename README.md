TPR Projecto 2019<br>
Universidade de Aveiro
Project where based on real-time traffic is given a profile with diferent permissions to internet content.

# Getting Started

### sniffer.py
`mainSniffer` - Prints all the traffic captured and information about it

output:
```
Ethernet Frame:
	 - Destination : 7C:C3:85:7A:40:F7, Source: 60:57:18:17:10:FB, Protocol: 56710

```

### genDataSet.py
`mainGen` - Creates a .dat file with the bytes captured per second
` genDataSet.py 'dataset name' 'dataset gen timer' `

output:
```
[0, 77, 0, 45, 7653, 53, 564, 0, 0, 27806, 4734, 13721, 4174, 11834, 355825, 70451, 77, 2181, 438227, 76862, 24, 8, 66, 0, 45, 77, 128, 0, 1036, 1128, 382, 8, 1692, 0, 45]
```

### ProfileClass.py
`plot` - Function that does a plot based on a data array and a name
`breakTrainTest` - Breaks data into trains
`extractFeatures` - Extracts features from trains
`plotFeatures` - Plots all the features
`distance` - Normal distance function

output: 
```
In the end the script shall output the statistical profile atribution in the following format
-- Classification based on Distances --
Obs:  0: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.0886,0.1313,0.7801] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
Obs:  1: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.0883,0.0991,0.8126] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
Obs:  2: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.2513,0.2599,0.4888] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
Obs:  3: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.2515,0.2588,0.4897] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
Obs:  4: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.2912,0.3653,0.3435] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
Obs:  5: Normalized Distances to Centroids: [0.2742,0.3511,0.3747] -> Classification: 0 -> Plot1
```

# Profile atribution
A profile is atributed based on the amount of bytes per second that the user sends/receives, this way it isn't need to verify the type(video, image, browsing...) of the packets but only the amount of bytes in transaction.

# Libraries
The following python libraries are need for the system to run
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* sklearn
* tkinter
